# Python_game


I decided to create this game as a personal challenge, aiming to hone my programming skills and broaden my knowledge without relying on tutorials. It's all about self-improvement and gearing up for future projects.

As for the game itself, it's a laid-back turn-based combat experience between two players. They have the freedom to choose their classes and equipment, adding a dash of strategy and customization to the mix.
